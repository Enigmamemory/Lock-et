<h1>Lock-et: Bike Security</h1>
<br>

<h2>Goal and Members</h2>

<p>As the use of bikes take off in various cities in the US, bike theft becomes 
more and more of a prominant issue. Lock-et will try to design a smart 
connected device that would readily tackle customers with problems regarding 
bike security</p>

<h2>Information Gathering: Becoming Knowledgable</h2>

<p>First things first, we must gain sufficient knowledge on the problem we're 
trying to tackle ourselves. We spend a week or so learning about bikes and bike 
security. For our results, check our research paper <a href="https://github.com/Enigmamemory/Lock-et/tree/master/research%20paper">folder.</a></p>
<br>

<h2>Brainstorming: Product/Market Fit</h2>

<br>

<p>In order to come up with a starting direction for our product, we used a 
model called Product/Market Fit. We attempt through this model to identify 
our customer segment's jobs, pains, and gains, then match them with a product 
that corrosponds to them.</p>

<p>For more information on the Product/Market Fit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSDvwQiPtgc">here's</a> a short video.</p>
<br>

<h2>Verifying the Customer Segment: Conducting Interviews</h2>

<p>To verify that we've correctly identified the pains and gains of our current 
customer segment (middle class Americans who live in cities and commute
daily with a bicycle), we went out on the streets and conducted interviews with 
various individuals that fit towards our demographic. These interviews will 
seek to identify what are the subjects' pains and gains and whether or not 
our value proposition would address them.</p>

<p>For more information on our interviews, consult our interviews <a href="https://github.com/Enigmamemory/Lock-et/tree/master/interviews">folder.</a></p>
<br>

<h2>Current Value Proposition</h2>

<p>As of right now, our value prop is a smart bike lock that attempts to alert 
both bike owners and bystanders that a bike is being stolen. This lock would be:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Protective both actively and passively</li>
<ul>
<li>Active: Alarm to alert bystanders</li>
<li>Passive: Lock acts as a deterrent</li>
</ul>
<li>Low cost</li>
<li>Good option for big cities and everyday commuters</li>
</ul>
