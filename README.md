<h1>Lock-et: Bike Security</h1>
<br>

<h2>Goal and Members</h2>

<p>As the use of bikes take off in various cities in the US, bike theft becomes 
more and more of a prominant issue. Lock-et will try to design a smart 
connected device that would readily tackle customers with problems regarding 
bike security</p>

<h2>Information Gathering: Becoming Knowledgable</h2>

<p>First things first, we must gain sufficient knowledge on the problem we're 
trying to tackle ourselves. We spend a week or so learning about bikes and bike 
security. For our results, check our research paper <a href="https://github.com/Enigmamemory/Lock-et/tree/master/research%20paper">folder.</a>

<h2>Brainstorming: Product/Market Fit</h2>

<br>

<p>In order to come up with a starting direction for our product, we used a 
model called Product/Market Fit. We attempt through this model to identify 
our customer segment's jobs, pains, and gains, then match them with a product 
that corrosponds to them.</p>
